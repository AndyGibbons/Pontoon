How to play
===========

When you run the game, you start playing by clicking on the "Deal" button. 
You will be dealt your first two cards, and the dealer their first. You
then choose how many more cards you wish to take, if any, up to 5 cards.
Be careful not to score more than 21 with your cards (picture cards have a 
value of 10,Aces either 1 or 11, and other cards their numeric value) or you 
will bust and the dealer will win without having to take anymore cards. When 
you whoose to stick with the cards you have, the dealer takes cards trying to 
beat you. The dealer must stick on 17 or above, but cannot stick lower than 
that.

The shoe (set of cards used in the game) contains four packs of cards, in case 
you fancy tring your hand at card counting. When the number of cards left in the 
shoe drops to under 10, the game creates a new shoe. You also start with £100 
and stake £5 on each hand. The game allows you to go into debt, so be careful 
not to lose your shirt!

Installation
============

This game is written in Python, so you need to have Python installed. Ensure that the images folder is located in the same forder as the pontoon.py 
file. You will also need to install Pygame:
